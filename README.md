# dbslice AR Visualiser

Built with [Networked-A-Frame](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe), a web framework for building multi-user virtual reality experiences. Works on desktop and mobile platforms.

Multiuser AR visualisation app using Networked-aframe, Aframe, AR.js, Three.js, d3.js, and hammerjs. UI using Materialize. Colorbar on AR. One colorbar.

Note: Had to modify aframe-ar.js and provide a custom implementation to fix the Android defaulting to front camera bug. Added a few lines of code starting from line 5970 in aframe-ar.js
